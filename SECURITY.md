# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This repository uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).  The latest MAJOR version is always supported for security updates.  Older MAJOR versions are supported for at least one year after the new version has been released.  In general, only the last 4 versions of the Python interpreter are supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/pronovic/smartapp-sdk/security/advisories/new) tab.

## Testing Expectations

As of January 2025, I have migrated my home automation infrastructure from SmartThings to Home Assistant, so I no longer actively use this software. If you submit an issue, please keep in mind that I no longer have a SmartThings environment to test with, so I will expect you to coordinate with me on testing before I release any changes.
